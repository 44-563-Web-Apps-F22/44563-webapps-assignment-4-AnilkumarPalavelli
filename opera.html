    <h4>The Gondolier Act 2</h4>
    <h5>SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
        Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
        occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
        are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
        etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
        degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
        distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
        reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.</h5>
        
        RECITATIVE

        <h4 class="MAR">MAR:</h4>
        <p class="speech">Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your
        expressions of satisfaction and good feeling—I say, we are much
        obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good
        feeling.</p>
        <h4 class="All">All:</h4>
        <p class="speech">We heard you.</p>
        <h4 class="MAR">MAR:</h4>
        <P class="speech">  We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with
        sentiments so charmingly expressed.</P>
        <h4 class="ALL">ALL:</h4>
        <p class="speech">  That's all right.</p>
        <h4  class="GIU">GIU:</h4>
        <p  class="speech">At the same time there is just one little grievance
        that we should like to ventilate.</p>
        <h4 class="ALL">ALL:<p class="direction">(angrily).</p></h4>
        <p  class="speech"> What?</p>
        <h4 class="GIU">GIU:</h4>
        <p class="speech">Don't be alarmed—it's not serious.  It is arranged
        that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we
        are to act as one person.</p>
        <h4 class="GIO">GIO:</h4>
        <p class="speech"> Exactly.</p>
        <h4 class="GIU">GIU:</h4>
        <p  class="speech"> Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point
        of fact, two persons.</p>
        <h4  class="ANN">ANN:</h4>
        <p  class="speech">  Ah, I don't think we can go into that.  It is a
        legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things.  Situated as
        we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.</p>
