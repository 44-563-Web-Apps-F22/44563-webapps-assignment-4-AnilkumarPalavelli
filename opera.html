    <h4>The Gondolier Act 2</h4>
    <h5>SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
        Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
        occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
        are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
        etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
        degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
        distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
        reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.</h5>
        <p>MAR:  Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your<br>
        expressions of satisfaction and good feeling—I say, we are much
        obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good
        feeling.<br>
        
        ALL:  We heard you.<br>
        
        MAR:  We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with
        sentiments so charmingly expressed.<br>
        
        ALL:  That's all right.
        
        GIU:  At the same time there is just one little grievance<br>
        that we should like to ventilate.
        
        ALL (angrily):  What?<br>
        
        GIU:  Don't be alarmed—it's not serious.  It is arranged
        that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we
        are to act as one person.<br>
        
        GIORGIO:  Exactly.<br>
        
        GIU:  Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point
        of fact, two persons.<br>
        
        ANNIBALE:  Ah, I don't think we can go into that.  It is a
        legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things.  Situated as
        we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.<br>
        
        GIU:  No; but you can recognize two independent appetites.
        It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you
        supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it
        as a legal fiction carried a little too far.<br>
        
        ANNI:  It's rather a nice point.  I don't like to express an
        opinion off-hand.  Suppose we reserve it for argument before the
        full Court?<br>
        
        MAR:  Yes, but what are we to do in the meantime?<br>
        
        MAR: and GIU.  We want our tea.<br>
        
        ANNI:  I think we may make an interim order for double
        rations on their Majesties entering into the usual undertaking to
        indemnify in the event of an adverse decision?</p>
